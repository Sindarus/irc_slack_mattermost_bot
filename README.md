This was developped for use inside ENSIIE Strasbourg and it may lack flexibility. However, feel free to fork it.

## How to run it
* install python 2.7
* install `irclib` and `ircbot` python modules with `sudo apt-get install python-irclib`
* install the pip module manager
* install the slack client module with `sudo pip install slackclient` (doc here [http://python-slackclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest])
* install web.py with `pip install web.py`

##Â Global functionning
This programm is about a bot, but it actually has 3 inside : one per plateform to deal with. When the three bots work together, the programm acts like a unique bot that has as many faces as there are plateforms.
There is one singleton class (one bot) per plateform to deal with : IrcBot for irc, mmbot for mattermost and SlackBot for slack. Actually, mmbot is not a class but a module. Functions defined in `mm_bot`, can be called like `mm_bot` was an object by importing the module with `import mm_bot`. Example : `mm_bot.start()`.
Each bot has a `start()` method, and each bot runs in a thread that is separated from the main thread. When one of the three bots receives a message, it calls `handle_msg()` in `central_unit.py`. This function is in charge of routing the messages to the right destination channels. Each bot has a `post_msg()` method that `handle_msg()` calls to send messages on a specific channel of said plateform.
